            <p>The beauty that surrounds me is absolutely breath taking- it is the happy faces of my children who carry immense possibilities. At MRIS-46 we believe that that wider the range of possibilities we offer to the children, the more intense will be their motivations and richer their experiences. This in turn will go a long way in nurturing in them a lifelong passion for learning.

                MRIS-46 strives to provide an outstanding 360 degree education to its student community in a safe environment. Apart from academic excellence, through multifarious activities and opportunities the school system focuses on character building, leadership building, development of artistic temperament, fostering sportsmanship, creating innovators and problem solvers of tomorrow while raising empathetic global citizens of the world.

                MRIS 46 is a progressive school that continues to evolve with the changing times and make itself adept to cater to the demands of the 21st century learner. The driving force behind the school’s success is a strong, dedicated and forward thinking team of facilitators.

                Incepted in 2008, the school has made its presence strongly felt in the educational community of not just the city but at the international level too. A repertoire of achievements at all levels by the school and its students validate the claim. Our very young alumni continue to keep the school banner high.

                We believe in working with parents in partnership. While teachers are there at the school front, parent support is much sought for to continue with the learning momentum at the home front. Regular communications between the two important stakeholders (facilitator and parent) ensure that the benefit flows to the child.

                The school also seriously holds its commitment to the society and world at large. An assortment of ISR activities aim at sensitizing the students to the needs of others and encourage them to contribute productively. The school has consciously adopted the UNSDGs as part of its curriculum in order to promote awareness and generate remedial thought and action.

                A successfully running inclusive and integrated Special Education Needs programme ensures that no child is left behind in the learning process.

                The journey of the school’s progress has been most fulfilling. While some milestones have been covered, there are many more to explore and achieve. We stand committed to our students in their journey to discover their true potential.</p>
